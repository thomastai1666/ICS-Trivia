# Project Description
This game is based off the popular trivia game app HQ Trivia. The server will send questions to the client, including all the possible answers to choose from. The user will then be able to send the answer back to the server, for example (A,B,C,D). If the answer is correct, the user will be given points. In the end, a list of the top players will be displayed. We hope to implement a GUI for the client.
